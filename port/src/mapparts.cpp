// Retail's DrawLOD raises a part that asks for a lift by its own distance from the eye: 0.02 of the
// lift within 100 units, then a thousandth of the distance up to 2. Neighbouring road tiles are
// separate parts, so each stands at a height of its own and the ground shows through the step
// between two of them: a fraction of a pixel on the PS2's frame, a line of grass along every tile
// edge on a larger one. The lift only keeps the part clear of the ground in the depth buffer, which
// the port's float depth does at any distance, so every part takes the one height retail gives a
// part 100 units away and neighbours meet edge to edge.
