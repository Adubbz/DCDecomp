"""Report every way the build differs from retail, and where.

    compare_build.py                          # everything, all images
    compare_build.py --section main           # one image
    compare_build.py --context 4              # more instructions per hit
    compare_build.py <retail_elf> <build_elf> # non-default paths

Two independent comparisons run, because neither implies the other:

CONTENT -- the bytes. Every differing byte is attributed to the symbol that
    owns it, via the address index disassemble.py writes (ref_index.py). Since
    that index records which dump a symbol came from, a hit in text is
    disassembled and reported as an instruction at an offset into a function,
    and a hit in data as the differing bytes. This is verify.py's pass/fail
    made specific.

PLACEMENT -- the symbol table. Un-migrated functions are reassembled from .s
    with retail's own bytes, so their addresses should coincide with retail's
    unless something earlier in the same region has a different size than the
    code it replaces. A name-joined, address-sorted comparison pinpoints the
    first symbol whose size or content diverges; everything after it differs
    only because of that. It also reports symbols whose size or occurrence
    count changed, and names the index knows that the build never defines.

Placement needs a symbol table, so it covers the main executable only -- the
overlays ship as raw images. Content covers all three.

Needs mips-ps2-decompals-nm/readelf/objdump on PATH, so run it in the dev
container:
