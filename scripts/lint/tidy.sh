# With no files, every unit under src/ is checked. The plugin's own source is
# checked as well, against tools/tidy-module/.clang-tidy. Each unit is checked twice,
# as NTSC and as PAL (-DPAL), since both releases compile from the same
# sources. The dcdecomp-* checks are a clang-tidy plugin built from
# tools/tidy-module against the installed clang (llvm-config and the
# clang-tidy headers are needed); it is rebuilt when its source or the
# installed LLVM changes. With --fix, the fixes of every run are merged and
# applied once all the runs have finished.
