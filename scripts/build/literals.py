"""Bind an object's float constants to retail's literal pool.

    literals.py --bind <object> [<object> ...]
    literals.py --resolve-names <image> <object> [<object> ...]
    literals.py --report <source or object>

A source writes the number. Nothing in it names an address, and nothing has to
be kept in step by hand: this reads the address each constant has to land on
out of retail and rewrites the object to use it.

## How the toolchain places a literal

Established by experiment against `tools/compilers/mw/2.3.3`, because the
manual describes only the first line of it.

MWCC gives each *distinct* float constant of a translation unit a `.lit4` or
`.lit8` section of its own, holding just that value, with a local `@<digits>`
symbol on it, and loads it through an `R_MIPS_LITERAL` relocation on a
gp-relative `lwc1` or `ld`. The numbers rise in order of first use -- they come
off the same counter as the compiler's other invented names, so they are not
contiguous -- and the sections appear in the object in the reverse of that
order. The deduplication is per translation unit and has no limit: one unit
with 64 other constants between two uses of `0.1f` still gets one section for
it, and a constant that reaches the same bits by another route --
`3.1415927f * 2.0f`, `(float) 6.283185307179586` -- lands on that same section.

Version 2.3 of the toolchain, which is also in the tree, does all of this
identically; see re/ai/build_pipeline.md.

MWLD's `LITERAL` directive then emits, at the point the directive stands:
every object's `.lit8` sections, then every object's `.lit4` sections; objects
in link order; and within an object, its sections in `@` order.

**It does not merge.** The manual says the directive "merges them so that you
do not have duplicate entries"; version 2.4 (Engineering Build 0017), which is
what `mwldmips.exe` here is, does not, not even when the two sections carry the
same value under the same `@` name. Retail's own pool holds `6.2831855f` 29
times over, which says the same thing about the linker that built it.

## Why that is not enough, and what is done instead

Retail's pool is in the image already -- the reference dump of `.rdata`
supplies it -- and it cannot be rebuilt from the objects until every
contributing unit is decompiled. So an object that brings its own copy of a
constant has that copy appended rather than merged, and the small data after
the pool moves. Writing `0.1f` in a source used to be enough to shift the
image.

Nor can retail's pool be predicted from the rules above. Retail's copy of the
pool holds one value at several addresses *within a single function* --
`DrawNPCDraw` loads `6.2831855f` from `0x2A1DBC` and again from `0x2A1DD0` --
and this MWCC cannot emit that, since it deduplicates per unit. Retail was
built by a toolchain that differs here.

What is left is retail's own instruction stream, which says exactly which entry
each load wants. `--bind` reads it, in four steps, stopping at the first that
answers:

1. **The same instruction.** The reference dump of the function the relocation
   sits in is opened and the instruction at that offset taken. If it is a
   gp-relative float load of the same value, that is the address. This is what
   a matching function resolves by.
2. **The same function, in order.** Otherwise the function's literal loads are
   lined up against ours in offset order and the *n*th load of a value is bound
   to retail's *n*th load of it. A function still being worked on gets retail's
   addresses before it matches, which is what stops the literal from being the
   thing that keeps it from matching.
3. **The same translation unit.** Otherwise any address the unit's other
   functions load that value from, taken from the unit's span in the linker
   script.
4. **The pool.** Otherwise the first entry in the pool holding that value. The
   constant is right and the game behaves the same; only that instruction's
   offset differs from retail's, and the unit not loading the value anywhere is
   worth saying so out loud.

A constant retail's pool does not hold at all is left where MWCC put it. MWLD
appends it, the small data after the pool moves, and `scripts/build/verify.py`
reports that as the failure it is.

Each bound relocation keeps the compiler's original `@<digits>` name as a
local absolute symbol at the selected retail address. `--resolve-names` does
the same for undefined `@` references introduced by generated assembly.
`--report` shows what a source's unit loads in retail, and what its object binds
to.
